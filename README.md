# Smart-Marketing-Unlocking-Campaign-Power-with-BI-Data-Science---Graduation-Project
Graduation Project in Performance Marketing Analysis


## -Introduction 

In the modern era of digital transformation, data has become the most “valuable asset” for 
businesses. Among various business sectors, marketing has undergone a significant shift from 
intuition-based strategies to data-driven decision-making. This transformation is largely due to the 
rise in performance marketing, where every aspect of a marketing campaign—such as ad 
impressions, clicks, conversions, and customer engagement—is measurable in real-time. 

Performance marketing, unlike traditional branding campaigns, focuses on results-driven strategies 
that are quantifiable. It relies heavily on data generated from online platforms such as Google Ads, 
Meta Ads (Facebook and Instagram), email campaigns, and influence collaborations. However, 
despite the availability of data, many businesses face challenges in harnessing their full potential. 
Raw data is often scattered across platforms, unstructured, and lacks actionable insights. 


## -Problem Statements 

The problem is that many businesses run marketing campaigns without fully understanding their 
performance. Their data is scattered across multiple platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and email 
marketing tools, making it difficult to analyze results in one place. Most of the analysis is done manually 
using Excel, which takes time, increases the chance of errors, and limits real-time decision-making. As a 
result, businesses struggle to identify which campaigns work best and miss opportunities to improve 
their marketing strategies. 

I want to solve this problem using Business Intelligence and Data Science. By building an automated data 
pipeline, performing advanced analysis, and applying machine learning models, I aim to help businesses 
turn raw marketing data into clear, actionable insights. This will support smarter, faster, and more 
effective marketing decisions.


## Objectives: 

1- Understanding the structure and business goals of performance marketing. 

2- Collecting and exploring relevant marketing datasets using Excel and Python. 

3- Building a scalable and reusable ETL pipeline in Python to automate data collection and 
transformation. 

4- Applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizing campaign metrics. 

5- Training a Machine Learning model to predict campaign performance metrics (e.g., CTR, 
Conversion Rate, ROI). 

6- Automating the ML and ETL process using pipelines for continuous updates. 

7- Designing interactive dashboards to showcase insights
